## Commit message rules

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. 
The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Note that [`check-commit-messages.sh`](/.github/scripts/check-commit-messages.sh) is
used to check conformance of commits in the pull request to commit message
format.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: When create a new feature.
- **fix**: When fix a bug.
- **docs**: When add or change documentation.
- **style**: When improve code style.
- **refactor**: When improve code without add or change feature.
- **perf**: When improve performance.
- **test**: When add or change test code.
- **chore**: When change build process or tool.
- **ci**: When change CI configuration files and scripts.
- **revert**: When revert a commit.

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. 
For example `deps-dev`, `workflows`, etc...

### Subject

The first part of the commit message begins with an infinitive, and the first letter is capitalized. 
It starts with commands such as `Fix`, `Add` and `Change` instead of past tense such as `Fixed`, `Added` 
and `Changed`. In addition, It does not exceed 72 characters and does not end with a period (.).

-   `Fixed` -> `Fix`
-   `Added` -> `Add`
-   `Changed` -> `Change`
